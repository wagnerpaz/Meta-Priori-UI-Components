#FlexColumns

   A table extension that provides additional features for column definition and user interaction.

##Features:
   
   * Dynamic column width. It's possible to define the column's preferred and minimum size using percent or pixel values.
   * Dynamic column resize. The dynamic widths are recalculated as the table or other columns are resized.
   * Show/hide control. The user can choose to show or hide the avaible columns from a popup menu on the table header.
   * The table state is automatically persisted in a file and loaded when the table is showed for the first time.
